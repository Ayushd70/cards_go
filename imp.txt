// Some Important Stuffs

Types of Data:

- Values Types (Use pointers to change these things in a function)
* int
* float
* string
* bool
* structs

- Reference Types (Don't worry about pointers these)
* slices
* maps
* channels
* pointers
* function

- Concrete Types(Create a value out of directly and access,change it ,make a copy)
* maps
* structs
* int
* string

- Interface Types(cannot create a value out of it directly)

- Interfaces (Some Imp Stuffs)
* Interfaces are not generic types
* Interfaces are implict
* Interfaces are a contract to help us manage types
